	AUTHORS: ELI PLANAS AND CHENNY CAO
	THIS CODE WAS COMPLETED ON SEPT. 25, 2019
	
	This program opens two files (one domestic and the other international student applicants)
	and puts their information (names and academic scores) into objects of child classes of the 
	parent class STUDENT.
	The two child classes created are for domestic student and the other for international students.
	Each child class have different class members and member functions except for the members and 
	member functions derived from the parent class.
	An additional class was used (particularly in use with the international student class) called 
	ToeflScore, in which has members that held data about international students' toefl scores and
	their totals.
